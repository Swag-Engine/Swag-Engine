# Friday Night Funkin': Swag Engine
## Friday Night Funkin'
**Friday Night Funkin'** is a rhythm game originally made for Ludum Dare 47 "Stuck In a Loop".

> Uh oh! Your tryin to kiss ur hot girlfriend, but her MEAN and EVIL dad is trying to KILL you! He's an ex-rockstar, the only way to get to his heart? The power of music... 

## Swag Engine
**Swag Engine** is a fork of Kade Engine providing my favorite features and ideas.

**REMEMBER**: This is a **mod**. This is not the vanilla game and should be treated as a **modification**. This is not and probably will never be official, so don't get confused.
